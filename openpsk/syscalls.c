 * OpenPSK - kernel syscall handlers, batch 2 (the status/serial/app-state SWIs).
 *
 * These complete the documented PocketStation system-call surface (PDA Kernel Spec, Table 3) beyond
 * the callback / RTC / flash / clock handlers in swi_handlers.c. They run in SVC mode, reached from
 * the swi.S dispatcher via `bx`, args in r0-r3, result in r0.
 *
 * Each is written from the contract - the kernel-spec signature plus the behaviour recovered from
 * the retail kernel disassembly - NOT transliterated from the assembly. Where the
 * retail kernel reaches a fixed WRAM address, we use the kernel-state model (kernel_state.h) so the
 * ABI those addresses form stays compatible with real applications and a real PlayStation.
 *
 * Deferred to the COM-engine chunk (they drive the comm-enable/disable + app-launch machinery that
 * is not yet implemented): SWI 5 (Switch kernel mode), 9 (Terminate/suspend app), 17 (Control PS
 * communication), 18 (Get application status).
