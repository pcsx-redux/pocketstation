/*
 * OpenPSK - card-link (COM) command engine.
 *
 * This is what makes OpenPSK a real PocketStation kernel rather than a sleep demo: its own
 * implementation of the serial card-link command engine the PlayStation drives. When the PDA is
 * docked in a PS Memory Card slot, the PS clocks SPI bytes at the device; the COM hardware raises a
 * FIQ (INT bit 6), and this engine answers - serving the standard PS1 Memory Card protocol
 * (read 0x52 / write 0x57 / get-id 0x53) in software, exactly as the retail kernel does.
 *
 * Reimplemented from the contract (the retail engine at 0x1058, the
 * com_exchange primitive at 0x1570, and card_read at 0x91E), NOT transliterated. The byte protocol
 * and the COM-register handshake are the parts that must match silicon; the control flow is ours.
 *
 * Model (verified by the COM-bridge work against the retail kernel):
 *   - COM_DATA is a single shift register each direction; COM_STAT2.bit0 (ready) is set when a host
 *     exchange completes and cleared when the kernel loads the next TX byte.
 *   - The whole command runs inside one FIQ invocation, busy-polling ready for each byte: the host
 *     feeds the next byte (another exchange) while the ARM core spins on ready between catch-up steps.
 *   - com_exchange(tx) loads TX, arms the link, and waits for the exchange to complete (bailing if the
 *     device is undocked or the link errors); the caller then reads COM_DATA for the received byte.
 *
 * Deferred to the next chunk (they need the application-FUNC dispatch / file directory): the PDA
 * commands 0x50 and 0x58-0x5F, including the FUNC execute handshake (0x5B/0x5C) that is the FF8
 * Chocobo World sync.
