/*
 * OpenPSK - kernel state model (the WRAM system area, 0x00..0x200).
 *
 * The PocketStation kernel keeps its live state at FIXED low-WRAM addresses. These are not an
 * implementation detail we are free to move: PocketStation applications and the card-link command
 * engine reach into this region by absolute address (ComFlags at 0xC0, the syscall-table pointer at
 * 0xE0, the callback slots at 0xF8, ...), so the layout is ABI. OpenPSK reimplements the kernel from
 * the documented + reverse-engineered contract, but must preserve these addresses so retail apps and
 * a real PlayStation see the same memory the retail kernel exposed.
 *
 * Layout reconstructed from the retail kernel disassembly and cross-checked against
 * psx-spx docs/pocketstation.md "Kernel RAM" + the PDA Kernel Specification:
 *
 *   0x00  exception vector opcodes (installed by crt0)
 *   0x20  exception vector target addresses
 *   0x40  sector / transfer buffer (128 bytes, used by the card-read/write + FUNC paths)
 *   0xC0  ComFlags (u32)            - communication / UI state bitfield (see PSK_CF_* below)
 *   0xC8  kernel status struct      - SWI 6 (Get PDA status) / SWI 23 return a pointer here
 *   0xCA  func-value byte           - PS_ChangeFuncValue (card cmd 0x50) stores its byte here
 *   0xCE  selection byte            - SWI 21 get/set, gated on the active application block number
 *   0xCF  RTC century byte          - the 2-digit-century the RTC hardware does not store
 *   0xD0  current dir_index          (u16) - the running file, 0 = the GUI; card cmd 0x5A reports it
 *   0xD2  active application block#  (u16) - SWI 8 set / SWI 22 get
 *   0xD4  application argument       (u32) - SWI 8
 *   0xD8  user-interface status struct - SWI 19 returns a pointer here
 *   0xE0  pointer to the SWI dispatch table (= &swi_table); installed by crt0
 *   0xF0  COM TX-reply byte / 0xF1 COM countdown byte - the card-link engine's handshake registers
 *   0xF8  4 user-callback addresses (software / IRQ / FIQ / PS-transfer) - SWI 1; see hardware.h
